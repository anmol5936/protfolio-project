<p class="para-a"><li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was first proposed by <b class="author-1">Tim Berners-Lee in 1989</b>, while he was working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. Berners-Lee created the first version of HTML to help scientists share information and collaborate on research projects, as he believed that a standardized markup language would make it easier to share and access information on the World Wide Web.</li>
    <li> first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1993, and it included basic tags for formatting text, creating headings, and inserting images. Over the years, new versions of HTML were developed, with each version introducing new features and functionality.</li>
   <li>HTML 2.0 was released in 1995, and it included support for tables and forms. HTML 3.2 was released in 1997, and it added support for frames and style sheets. HTML 4.0 was released in 1997, and it introduced new tags and attributes for creating more complex layouts and interactivity.</li>
    <li>2000, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language), which was a reformulation of HTML 4.0 as an XML (Extensible Markup Language) application. XHTML was designed to be more compatible with other XML-based technologies, such as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and MathML (Mathematical Markup Language).</li>
    <li>In 2014, the latest version of HTML, HTML5, was released. HTML5 includes new tags and attributes for creating multimedia content, such as video and audio, as well as new JavaScript APIs for creating more interactive web applications.
    Today, HTML remains a critical component of web development, and it is used by millions of web developers around the world to create web pages and web applications.</li>

    <li>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used for describing the presentation of web pages, including colors, layouts, fonts, and other design elements.</li>

    <li>The early days: The first version of CSS, known as CSS1, was introduced in 1996 as a way to separate the presentation of a web page from its structure. This allowed designers to create more flexible layouts and styles without having to modify the HTML code directly.</li>
    
    <li>Expansion of CSS: CSS2 was introduced in 1998 and included many new features, such as support for positioning and layout, as well as the ability to define media types and devices for different styles. CSS3, which was released in 1999, introduced even more features, including support for animations, transitions, and transformations.</li>
    
    <li>Adoption and standardization: As CSS became more popular, web browsers started to add support for the language, making it easier for designers to create and style web pages. In 1998, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) established a CSS working group to develop and standardize the language.</li>
    
    <li>Modern CSS: Today, CSS continues to evolve and improve, with new features and updates being added regularly. CSS has become a key component of web design, allowing designers to create visually appealing and functional websites that are easy to maintain and update. Some of the recent developments in CSS include the introduction of CSS Grid and Flexbox, which provide powerful tools for creating complex layouts and responsive designs.</li>

    <li>The early days: JavaScript was created by <b class="author-2">Brendan Eich </b> just 10 days in May 1995. Originally called Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and then finally to JavaScript. The language was initially developed for the Netscape Navigator browser, and its primary purpose was to add interactivity to web pages.</li>

    <li>Widespread adoption: JavaScript quickly gained popularity among web developers due to its ability to create dynamic and interactive web pages. In 1997, Microsoft introduced JScript, a version of JavaScript for Internet Explorer, further solidifying the language's position as a key component of web development.</li>

    <li>Standardization and growth: In 1996, JavaScript was submitted to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) to be standardized. This resulted in the creation of ECMAScript, which is the official name for the language that JavaScript is based on. ECMAScript 3 was released in 1999, and ECMAScript 5 in 2009, which introduced many new features, including strict mode and support for JSON.</li>

    <li>Modern JavaScript: Today, JavaScript continues to grow and evolve, with new features and updates being added regularly. ECMAScript 6, released in 2015, introduced many new features, including arrow functions, template literals, and classes. Modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React and Angular have also become popular, allowing developers to create complex web applications with ease.</li>

    <li> early days: Bootstrap was created by two Twitter employees, <b class="author-3">Mark Otto</b> and <b class="author-4">Jacob Thornton</b>, in 2010 as an internal tool to help standardize their web development process. It was initially called Twitter Blueprint, but was later renamed to Bootstrap and released as an open-source project in 2011.</li>

    <li>Rapid adoption and growth: Bootstrap quickly gained popularity among web developers due to its ease of use and ability to create responsive and mobile-friendly web designs. Its popularity was further boosted by its inclusion in many popular content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress and Drupal. Bootstrap 2 was released in 2012, and Bootstrap 3 in 2013, which introduced many new features and improvements.</li>

    <li>The move to Sass: In 2015, Bootstrap 4 was announced, and with it came a major change: the move from Less to Sass as the preprocessor of choice. This allowed for more flexible and powerful styling options, and helped to further standardize the development process.</li>

    <li>Modern Bootstrap: Today, Bootstrap remains one of the most popular CSS frameworks for web development. Bootstrap 5 was released in 2021, which streamlined the framework, removed jQuery as a dependency, and introduced new components and utilities.</li>
